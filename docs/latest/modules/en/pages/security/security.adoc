This section describes the methodology and means of securing a K3s cluster. It's broken into 2 sections. These guides assume k3s is running with embedded etcd.

First the hardening guide provides a list of security best practices to secure a K3s cluster.

Second, is the self assessment to validate a hardened cluster. We currently have two different assessments available:

* xref:security/self-assessment-1.9.adoc[CIS 1.9 Benchmark Self-Assessment Guide], for K3s version v1.27-v1.29
* xref:security/self-assessment-1.10.adoc[CIS 1.10 Benchmark Self-Assessment Guide], for K3s version v1.28-v1.31
* xref:security/self-assessment-1.11.adoc[CIS 1.11 Benchmark Self-Assessment Guide], for K3s version v1.29-v1.34
