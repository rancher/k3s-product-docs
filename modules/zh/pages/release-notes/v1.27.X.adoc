* Add FilterCN function to prevent SAN Stuffing https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/8085[(#8085)]
 ** K3s's external apiserver listener now declines to add to its certificate any subject names not associated with the kubernetes apiserver service, server nodes, or values of the --tls-san option. This prevents the certificate's SAN list from being filled with unwanted entries.
* Bump docker/docker to master commit; cri-dockerd to 0.3.4 https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/8092[(#8092)]

 ** The version of `helm` used by the bundled helm controller's job image has been updated to v3.12.3
* E2E: Add test for `k3s token` https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/8184[(#8184)]

=== Changes since v1.27.2+k3s1:

* Update flannel version https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/7628[(#7628)]
 ** Update flannel to v0.22.0
* Add el9 selinux rpm https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/7635[(#7635)]
* Update channels https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/7634[(#7634)]
* Allow coredns override extensions https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/7583[(#7583)]
 ** The `coredns-custom` ConfigMap now allows for `*.override` sections to be included in the `.:53` default server block.
* Bump klipper-lb to v0.4.4 https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/7617[(#7617)]
 ** Bumped klipper-lb image to v0.4.4 to resolve an issue that prevented access to ServiceLB ports from localhost when the Service ExternalTrafficPolicy was set to Local.
* Bump metrics-server to v0.6.3 and update tls-cipher-suites https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/7564[(#7564)]
 ** The bundled metrics-server has been bumped to v0.6.3, and now uses only secure TLS ciphers by default.
* Do not use the admin kubeconfig for the supervisor and core controllers https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/7616[(#7616)]
 ** The K3s core controllers (supervisor, deploy, and helm) no longer use the admin kubeconfig. This makes it easier to determine from access and audit logs which actions are performed by the system, and which are performed by an administrative user.
* Bump golang:alpine image version https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/7619[(#7619)]
* Make LB image configurable when compiling k3s https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/7626[(#7626)]

* Use el8 rpm for fedora 38 and 39 https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/7664[(#7664)]
* Check variant before version to decide rpm target and packager closes #7666 https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/7667[(#7667)]

* Soft-fail on node password verification if the secret cannot be created https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/7655[(#7655)]
 ** K3s now allows nodes to join the cluster even if the node password secret cannot be created at the time the node joins. The secret create will be retried in the background. This resolves a potential deadlock created by fail-closed validating webhooks that block secret creation, where the webhook is unavailable until new nodes join the cluster to run the webhook pod.
* Enable containerd aufs/devmapper/zfs snapshotter plugins https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/7661[(#7661)]
 ** The bundled containerd's aufs/devmapper/zfs snapshotter plugins have been restored. These were unintentionally omitted when moving containerd back into the k3s multicall binary in the previous release.
* Bump docker go.mod https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/7681[(#7681)]
* Shortcircuit commands with version or help flags https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/7683[(#7683)]

* Fix spelling check https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/7740[(#7740)]
* Remove useless libvirt config https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/7745[(#7745)]
* Bump helm-controller to v0.15.0 for create-namespace support https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/7716[(#7716)]
