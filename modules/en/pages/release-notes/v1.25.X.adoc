 ** K3s's external apiserver listener now declines to add to its certificate any subject names not associated with the kubernetes apiserver service, server nodes, or values of the --tls-san option. This prevents the certificate's SAN list from being filled with unwanted entries.
 ** K3s no longer enables the apiserver's `enable-aggregator-routing` flag when the egress proxy is not being used to route connections to in-cluster endpoints.
 ** Updated the embedded containerd to v1.7.3+k3s1
 ** Updated the embedded runc to v1.1.8
 ** User-provided containerd config templates may now use `{{ template "base" . }}` to include the default K3s template content. This makes it easier to maintain user configuration if the only need is to add additional sections to the file.
 ** Bump docker/docker module version to fix issues with cri-dockerd caused by recent releases of golang rejecting invalid host headers sent by the docker client.
 ** Updated kine to v0.10.2
* K3s etcd-snapshot delete fail to delete local file when called with s3 flag https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/8145[(#8145)]
* Fix for cluster-reset backup from s3 when etcd snapshots are disabled https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/8169[(#8169)]
* Fixed the etcd retention to delete orphaned snapshots based on the date https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/8190[(#8190)]
* Additional backports for 2023-08 release https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/8213[(#8213)]
 ** The version of `helm` used by the bundled helm controller's job image has been updated to v3.12.3
 ** Bumped dynamiclistener to address an issue that could cause the apiserver/supervisor listener on 6443 to stop serving requests on etcd-only nodes.
 ** The K3s external apiserver/supervisor listener on 6443 now sends a complete certificate chain in the TLS handshake.
* Move flannel to 0.22.2 https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/8223[(#8223)]
* Update to v1.25.13 https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/8241[(#8241)]

* Add new CLI flag to enable TLS SAN CN filtering https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/8259[(#8259)]
 ** Added a new `--tls-san-security` option. This flag defaults to false, but can be set to true to disable automatically adding SANs to the server's TLS certificate to satisfy any hostname requested by a client.
* Add RWMutex to address controller https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/8275[(#8275)]

* Backport version bumps and bugfixes https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/7718[(#7718)]
 ** The bundled metrics-server has been bumped to v0.6.3, and now uses only secure TLS ciphers by default.
 ** The `coredns-custom` ConfigMap now allows for `*.override` sections to be included in the `.:53` default server block.
 ** The K3s core controllers (supervisor, deploy, and helm) no longer use the admin kubeconfig. This makes it easier to determine from access and audit logs which actions are performed by the system, and which are performed by an administrative user.
 ** Bumped klipper-lb image to v0.4.4 to resolve an issue that prevented access to ServiceLB ports from localhost when the Service ExternalTrafficPolicy was set to Local.
 ** Make LB image configurable when compiling k3s
 ** K3s now allows nodes to join the cluster even if the node password secret cannot be created at the time the node joins. The secret create will be retried in the background. This resolves a potential deadlock created by fail-closed validating webhooks that block secret creation, where the webhook is unavailable until new nodes join the cluster to run the webhook pod.
 ** The bundled containerd's aufs/devmapper/zfs snapshotter plugins have been restored. These were unintentionally omitted when moving containerd back into the k3s multicall binary in the previous release.
 ** The embedded helm controller has been bumped to v0.15.0, and now supports creating the chart's target namespace if it does not exist.

// v1.25.9+k3s1

This release updates Kubernetes to v1.25.9, and fixes a number of issues.

For more details on what's new, see the https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.25.md#changelog-since-v1258[Kubernetes release notes].

=== Changes since v1.25.8+k3s1:

* Enhance `check-config` https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/7164[(#7164)]
* Remove deprecated nodeSelector label beta.kubernetes.io/os (#6970) https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/7121[(#7121)]
* Backport version bumps and bugfixes https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/7228[(#7228)]
 ** The bundled local-path-provisioner version has been bumped to v0.0.24
 ** The bundled runc version has been bumped to v1.1.5
 ** The bundled coredns version has been bumped to v1.10.1
 ** When using an external datastore, K3s now locks the bootstrap key while creating initial cluster bootstrap data, preventing a race condition when multiple servers attempted to initialize the cluster simultaneously.
 ** The client load-balancer that maintains connections to active server nodes now closes connections to servers when they are removed from the cluster. This ensures that agent components immediately reconnect to a current cluster member.
 ** Fixed a race condition during cluster reset that could cause the operation to hang and time out.
* Updated kube-router to move the default ACCEPT rule at the end of the chain https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/7221[(#7221)]
 ** The embedded kube-router controller has been updated to fix a regression that caused traffic from pods to be blocked by any default drop/deny rules present on the host. Users should still confirm that any externally-managed firewall rules explicitly allow traffic to/from pod and service networks, but this returns the old behavior that was relied upon by some users.
* Update klipper lb and helm-controller https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/7240[(#7240)]
* Update Kube-router ACCEPT rule insertion and install script to clean rules before start https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/7276[(#7276)]

* Wait for kubelet port to be ready before setting https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/7064[(#7064)]
 ** The agent tunnel authorizer now waits for the kubelet to be ready before reading the kubelet port from the node object.
* Adds a warning about editing to the containerd config.toml file https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/7075[(#7075)]

For more details on what's new, see the https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.25.md#changelog-since-v1256[Kubernetes release notes].

=== Changes since v1.25.6+k3s1:

* Add jitter to scheduled snapshots and retry harder on conflicts https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6782[(#6782)]
 ** Scheduled etcd snapshots are now offset by a short random delay of up to several seconds. This should prevent multi-server clusters from executing pathological behavior when attempting to simultaneously update the snapshot list ConfigMap. The snapshot controller will also be more persistent in attempting to update the snapshot list.
* Bump cri-dockerd https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6798[(#6798)]
 ** The embedded cri-dockerd has been updated to v0.3.1
* Bugfix: do not break cert-manager when pprof is enabled https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6837[(#6837)]
* Wait for cri-dockerd socket https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6853[(#6853)]
* Bump vagrant boxes to fedora37 https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6858[(#6858)]
* Fix cronjob example https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6864[(#6864)]
* Ensure flag type consistency https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6867[(#6867)]
* Consolidate E2E tests https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6887[(#6887)]
* Ignore value conflicts when reencrypting secrets https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6919[(#6919)]
* Use default address family when adding kubernetes service address to SAN list https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6904[(#6904)]
 ** The apiserver advertised address and IP SAN entry are now set correctly on clusters that use IPv6 as the default IP family.
* Allow ServiceLB to honor `ExternalTrafficPolicy=Local` https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6907[(#6907)]
 ** ServiceLB now honors the Service's ExternalTrafficPolicy. When set to Local, the LoadBalancer will only advertise addresses of Nodes with a Pod for the Service, and will not forward traffic to other cluster members.
* Fix issue with servicelb startup failure when validating webhooks block creation https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6916[(#6916)]
 ** The embedded cloud controller manager will no longer attempt to unconditionally re-create its namespace and serviceaccount on startup. This resolves an issue that could cause a deadlocked cluster when fail-closed webhooks are in use.
* Backport user-provided CA cert and `kubeadm` bootstrap token support https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6929[(#6929)]
 ** K3s now functions properly when the cluster CA certificates are signed by an existing root or intermediate CA. You can find a sample script for generating such certificates before K3s starts in the github repo at https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/blob/master/contrib/util/certs.sh[contrib/util/certs.sh].
 ** K3s now supports `kubeadm` style join tokens. `k3s token create` now creates join token secrets, optionally with a limited TTL.
 ** K3s agents joined with an expired or deleted token stay in the cluster using existing client certificates via the NodeAuthorization admission plugin, unless their Node object is deleted from the cluster.
* Fix access to hostNetwork port on NodeIP when egress-selector-mode=agent https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6936[(#6936)]
 ** Fixed an issue that would cause the apiserver egress proxy to attempt to use the agent tunnel to connect to service endpoints even in agent or disabled mode.
* Updated flannel version to v0.21.1 https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6915[(#6915)]
* Allow for multiple sets of leader-elected controllers https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6941[(#6941)]
 ** Fixed an issue where leader-elected controllers for managed etcd did not run on etcd-only nodes
* Fix etcd and ca-cert rotate issues https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6954[(#6954)]
* Fix ServiceLB dual-stack ingress IP listing https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6987[(#6987)]
 ** Resolved an issue with ServiceLB that would cause it to advertise node IPv6 addresses, even if the cluster or service was not enabled for dual-stack operation.
* Bump kine to v0.9.9 https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6975[(#6975)]
 ** The embedded kine version has been bumped to v0.9.9. Compaction log messages are now omitted at `info` level for increased visibility.

=== Changes since v1.25.5+k3s2:

* Pass through default tls-cipher-suites https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6730[(#6730)]
 ** The K3s default cipher suites are now explicitly passed in to kube-apiserver, ensuring that all listeners use these values.

* Bump containerd to v1.6.14-k3s1 https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/pull/6694[(#6694)]
 ** The embedded containerd version has been bumped to v1.6.14-k3s1. This includes a backported fix for https://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues/7843[containerd/7843] which caused pods to lose their CNI info when containerd was restarted, which in turn caused the kubelet to recreate the pod.

== ⚠️ WARNING

This release is affected by https://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues/7843, which causes the kubelet to restart all pods whenever K3s is restarted. For this reason, we have removed this K3s release from the channel server. Please use `v1.25.5+k3s2` instead.
____

This release updates Kubernetes to v1.25.5, and fixes a number of issues.

*Breaking Change:* K3s no longer includes `swanctl` and `charon` binaries. If you are using the ipsec flannel backend, please ensure that the strongswan `swanctl` and `charon` packages are installed on your node before upgrading K3s to this release.
